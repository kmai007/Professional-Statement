# Professional-Statement

I am driven about IT security and enjoy contributing to technological solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves.  What I am most passionate about is preventing unauthorized actors from undermining an organization's integrity.  What differentiates me from my peers is my willingness to never stop learning.  Always finding ways to be more efficient.  Some of my strengths I am most proud of are Critical thinking, Strong written and verbal communication, time management, and willingness to always help.
